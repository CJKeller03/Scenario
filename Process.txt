Rules:
    1. Use only third person descriptions
        a. - Use names instead of pronouns
    2. Use only past tense, maybe past progressive (ran vs was running)

Methods:
    1. Use a context-free grammar. Recursively generate the sentence using randomly chosen phrases
        a. Steal the word list from https://github.com/nicholascjones/random-sentence-generator/

        Use a dict to map what parts of speech can follow other parts of speech and randomly expand all nodes until the sentence is complete

        START -> {prepositional phrase}, {noun phrase}, {subject}
        {prepositional phrase} -> {noun phrase}, {prepositional phrase}, {subject}, {conjunction} (if the current clause has a verb in it),
                                  {adverb}
        {noun phrase} -> {conjunction}, {prepositional phrase}, {adverb}

        Pick a random part of speech that is allowed to follow the current one and repeat until the selected node is "END"

    2. Start with base sentences
        "{Prep phrase}, the {adjective} {subject} {verb phrase}, {conjunction} {adverb} {verb phrase}."
        "{Subject} {verb phrase} {prepositional phrase}."
        "{noun phrase} {verb phrase} {subject} {conjunction} {verb phrase} {prepositional phrase}."

        Recursively expand {} nodes until there are none left then return the sentence
